# 14. AI Reasoning Methods for Robotics
## 14.1. Why Should a Robot Use AI-Type Reasoning?
**Reasoning** means inferring the needed knowledge from what is spelled out explicitly in the available knowledge.
**Automated reasoning** means using AI methods such as knowledge representation and inference, heuristic search, and machine learning.

- An important task of AI reasoning techniques is: 
given a vague instruction, infer what is the appropriate action, what is the appropriate object to be acted on,
what is the appropriate order of action executions, and
what is the appropriate way of performing every action

Important kinds of reasoning that robots should be capable of:
- **Prediction**: what will probably happen if the intended action is executed?
- **Envisioning**: inferring all possible events and effects that will happen if a plan gets executed hypothetically.
- **Diagnosis**: inferring the cause of a particular event or effect in plan execution.
- **Query answering**: given some preconditions for plan execution, inferring pieces of knowledge that satisfy these preconditions.

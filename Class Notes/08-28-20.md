## The Deliberative Paradigm

### Functional Modules
**High Level**: Sensing -> Planning -> Action\
**More Detailed**: Sensing -> Perception -> Modeling -> Planning -> Task Execution -> Motor Cotrol -> Movements

### Sensing
**Transducer**: a device that converts a physical or chemical quantity to an electrical signal

| Types of Senses | Physical or Chemical Quantity Sensed |
| ----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Sight           | Photons (light)                      |
| Proprioception  | Awareness of Body Position           |

### Perception
**Definition**: Perception is an active process in which hypotheses are formed about the environment. Sensory information is sought that will confirm or refute these hypotheses.

### Modeling

### Planning
How do you get from one state to the other?

Blocks example:\
A&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;C\
B&emsp;->&emsp;B\
C&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A

### Task Execution

### Motor Control

### Movements
Sends movement signals to motors and monitor for success.

### Where are Robots Used?
- autonomous driving
- medical field
- factory manufacturing
- NASA rovers
- search and rescue

### Three D's of Robotics
- dirty, dull, and dangerous

### Robotic Paradigms
1. **Hierarchical / Functional Modules / Deliberative**: sense -> plan -> act
2. **Reactive / Behavior-Based**: sense -> act
3. **Hybrid Deliberative / Reactive**: sense and plan -> act

### Evaluating Robot Paradigms
- support for modularity (like OOP / software engineering)
- niche targetability (does it work well for the intended application?)
- ease of portablity (to other domains, applications, or robots)
- robustness (can it deal with unexpected situations?)
